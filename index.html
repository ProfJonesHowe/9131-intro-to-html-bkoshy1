	<h2> What's my favorite season, you may ask?</h2>
	<p> My favorite season is autumn!!! I love when the orange and yellow leaves fall
	and when the weather starts to get a bit colder. Autumn reminds me of halloween,
	which is one of my favorite holidays. IIt's the perfect time to get a pumpkin spice
	latte. :) </p>
